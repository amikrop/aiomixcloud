Basic data structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module contains the basic data structures used throughout
the package.  Specifically:

    - :class:`_WrapMixin`, a mixin providing type casting of
      accessed items.

    - :class:`AccessDict`, dict-like, supports accessing items
      by attribute.  Accessed items are properly wrapped.

    - :class:`AccessList`, list-like, supports accessing
      :class:`Resource` items by their "key" key.  Accessed items
      are properly wrapped.

    - :class:`Resource`, like an :class:`AccessDict` which has
      a "type" key.  Gets methods for downloading its "connections",
      that is the sub-entities "owned" by the resource.
      Mirrors methods of :class:`~aiomixcloud.core.Mixcloud` marked as
      "targeted" with their first argument as its key.  Also provides
      a :meth:`Resource.load` method to download full resource
      information in case it is partly loaded as an element of another
      API response.

    - :class:`ResourceList`, like an :class:`AccessDict` which
      delegates string indexing and iterating over, to its "data" item.
      Supports pagination through the :meth:`ResourceList.previous`
      and :meth:`ResourceList.next` methods, which return a new object
      with the respective data.
